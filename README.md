# Game Description: Tic-Tac-Toe
# 1. Introduction
Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses (O and X), is a two-player strategy game played on a simple 3×3 grid. Despite its simplicity, it demonstrates fundamental concepts of game theory, strategy optimization, and decision-making. It is widely used in computer science as a beginner’s example of algorithms such as minimax and game tree search.

# 2. Objective of the Game
The main goal is:

To place three of your marks (X or O) in a row on the grid.

The row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.

If all 9 cells are filled without either player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

# 3. Rules of Play
The game board is a 3×3 square grid (9 cells).

Two players take turns:

Player 1 usually uses X.

Player 2 usually uses O.

On each turn, a player places their mark in an empty cell.

The first player to form a line of three marks (row, column, or diagonal) wins the game.

If all cells are filled and no player has formed a winning line, the result is a draw.
